    "#### Small is Better\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Start small: if possible, use Pandas. Also, try to reduce your data using aggregation, then use Pandas.\n",
    "+ More generally, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn may have faster functions for what you need. Consult the relevant documentation, experiment, and/or consult with a colleague or expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index with Care\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Use the index: it is beneficial to have a well-defined index in Dask DataFrames, as it may speed up searching (filtering) the data. A one-dimensional index is allowed.\n",
    "+ Minimize full-data shuffling as much as possible: indexing is an expensive operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Consider the Cost of Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Consider cases such as small-to-large joins, where the small dataframe fits in memory, but the large one does not. The small dataframe can be Pandas, while the larger one is a Dask dataframe.\n",
    "+ Some joins are more expensive than others. \n",

    "    * Not expensive:\n",
