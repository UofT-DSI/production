    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Working with code in production is hard. Rarely we will have a chance to work on a greenfield development and will get a chance to define all of its specifications.\n",
    "+ Sometimes, we may be offered the option of scraping a system and starting from scratch. This option should be considered carefully and, most of the time, rejected.\n",
    "+ Working with legacy code will be the norm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Legacy code includes our own code.\n",
    "    - Legacy code may have been written by colleagues with different approaches, philosophies, and skills.\n",
    "    - Legacy code may have been written for old technology.\n",

    "## Software Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Software entroy is the natural evolution of code towards chaos.\n",
    "+ Messy code is a natural consequence of change:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Requirements change.\n",
    "    - Technology change.\n",
    "    - Business processes change.\n",
    "    - People change.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Software entropy can be managed. Some techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Apply a code style.\n",
    "    - Reduce inconsistency.\n",
    "    - Continuous refactoring.\n",
    "    - Apply reasonable architectures.\n",
    "    - Apply design patterns.\n",
    "    - Testing and CI/CD.\n",
    "    - Documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ *Technical debt* is future work that is owed to fix issues with the current codebase.\n",
    "+ Technical debt has principal and interest: complexity spreads and what was a simple *duct tape* solution becomes the source of complexity in downstream consumers.\n",
    "+ ML systems are complex: they involve many components and the interaction among those components determines the behaviour of the system. Adding additional complexity by using poor software development practices can be avoided.\n",
    "+ Building ML Systems is most of the time a team sport. Our tools should be designed for collaboration."

    "    - `./data/` is a general data folder which is generally subdivided in a namespace. \n",

    "    - `./env/` is the Python virtual environment. It is included in `.gitignore`.\n",
    "    - `./logs/` is the location of log files. It is included in `.gitignore`.\n",
    "    - `./src/` is the source folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "        * Contains most of the modules and module folders.\n",
    "        * It is the reference directory to all relative paths.\n",

    "    - `./src/.env` contains environment variable definitions. \n",

    "        * We will add settings to this file and read them throughout our setup.\n",
    "        * A single convenient location to maintain connection strings to DB, directory locations, and settings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `./readme.md` a description of the project and general guidance on where to find information in the repo.\n",
    "    - `./requirements.txt` Python libraries that are required for this repo.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Commit early and commit often.\n",
    "+ Use meaningful commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The drawback of commiting very frequently is that there will be incomplete commits, errors and stepbacks in the commit messages. Commit messages include: \"Committing before switching to another task\", \"Oops\", \"Undoing previous idea\", \"Fire alarm\", etc.\n",
    "    - In Pull Requests, squash commits and write meaningful messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Apply a branch strategy.\n",
    "+ Submit clean pull requests: verify that latest branch is merged and review conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commit Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Clear commit messages help document your code and allow you to trace the reaoning behind design decisions. \n",
    "+ A few guidelines for writing commit messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use markdown: Github interprets commit messages as markdown.\n",
    "    - First line is a subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * No period at the end.\n",
    "        * Use uppercase as appropriate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Write in imperative form in the subject line and whenever possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Do:  \"Add connection to db\", \"Connect to db\"\n",
    "        * Do not:  \"This commit adds a connection to db\", \"Connection to db added\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The body of the message should explain why the change was made and not what was changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Diff will show changes in the code, but not the reasoning behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Same rules apply for Pull Requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Many of these points are taken from [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) by Chris Beams."

    "# Using Docker to Set Up a Dev DB\n",
    "\n",
    "+ For our work, we need an environment that resembles the production environment as closely as possible. \n",
    "+ One way to achieve this is to use containers and containerized application. \n",
    "+ Without going into the details, you can think of a container as software that encapsulates the key features of an operating system, a programming language, and the application code.\n",
    "+ Containers are meant to be portable across operating systems: a container will work the same regardless if the underlying Docker application is installed in a Windows, Linux or Mac machine.\n",
    "+ Containers are not Virtual Machines.\n",
    "+ Docker is a popular application that implement containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ From product documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To setup a DB Server using containers, we will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download an image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).\n",
    "2. If required, set up a volume to [persist data](https://docs.docker.com/guides/walkthroughs/persist-data/).\n",
    "3. Redirect ports as needed.\n",
    "4. Start the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We will follow these steps two times: once to setup a PostgreSQL server and again to start the PgAdmin4 service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting the Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To run the process above, first navigate to the `./05_src/db/` folder, then run `docker compose up -d`. \n",
    "+ The flag `-d` indicates that we will do a headless run. \n",
    "+ Notice that the containers are set to always restart. You can remove the option or turn the containers off manually. Be aware that if you leave this option on, the containers will run any time your Docker desktop restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stopping the Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To stop the containers use (from `./05_src/db/`): `docker compose stop`.\n",
    "+ Alternatively, you can bring all images down including their volumes with: `docker compose down -v`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - The `-v` flag removes volumes. \n",
    "    - It is the best option when you are do not need the data any more because **it will delete the data in your DB **. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to PgAdmin\n",
    "\n",
    "+ PgAdmin4 is management software for PostgreSQL Server.\n",
    "+ You can open the local implementation by navigating to [http://localhost:5051](http://localhost:5051/). You will find a screen like the one below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/01_pgadmin_login.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Login using the credentials specified in the file `./05_src/db/.env`. Notice there are two sets of credentials, use the ones for PgAdmin4. After authentication, you will see a screen like the one below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/01_pgadmin_initial.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Click on \"Add New Server\":\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the *General* Tab, under Name enter: localhost. \n",
    "    - Under the *Connection* Tab, use Host name *db* (this is the name of the service in the docker compose file). \n",
    "    - Username and password are the ones found in the `./05_src/db/.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn More\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Containers and containerization are topics well beyond the scope of this course. However, we will use containerized applications to help us implement certain patterns. \n",
