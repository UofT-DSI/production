    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Working with code in production is hard. \n",
    "+ We will rarely have the chance to work on a greenfield development and will be able to define all its specifications. Most of the time, we will work in collaborative environments and use code to produce outputs and to communicate with colleagues (and ourselves in the future).\n",
    "+ Sometimes, we may be offered the option to scrap a system and start from scratch. This option should be considered carefully and, most of the time, rejected.\n",
    "+ Working with legacy code will be the norm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Legacy code includes our own code.\n",
    "    - Legacy code may have been written by colleagues with different approaches, philosophies, and skills.\n",
    "    - Legacy code may have been written for old technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Most of the time, legacy code works and *this* is the reason we are working with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Software entropy is the natural evolution of code towards chaos.\n",
    "+ Messy code is a natural consequence of change:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Requirements change.\n",
    "    - Technology change.\n",
    "    - Business processes change.\n",
    "    - People change.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Software entropy can be managed. Some techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Apply a code style.\n",
    "    - Reduce inconsistency.\n",
    "    - Continuous refactoring.\n",
    "    - Apply reasonable architectures.\n",
    "    - Apply design patterns.\n",
    "    - Testing and CI/CD.\n",
    "    - Documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Debt\n",
    "\n",
    "+ *Technical debt* is future work that is owed to fix issues with the current codebase.\n",
    "+ Technical debt has principal and interest: complexity spreads and what was a simple *duct tape* solution becomes the source of complexity in downstream consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity of ML Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ML systems are complex: they involve many components, and the interaction among those components determines the behaviour of the system. Adding additional complexity by using poor software development practices can be avoided.\n",
    "+ Building ML Systems is most of the time a team sport. Our tools should be designed for collaboration."

    "+ If you have not done so, please get an account on [Github](https://github.com/) and set up SSH authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check for [existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys).\n",

    "    - [Add SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account) to your Github account.\n",

    "* Things to avoid putting in a repo: Personal Identity Information (PII), passwords and keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version Control System Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Commit early and commit often.\n",
    "+ Use meaningful commits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The drawback of committing very frequently is that there will be incomplete commits, errors, and stepbacks in the commit messages. Commit messages include: \"Committing before switching to another task\", \"Oops\", \"Undoing previous idea\", \"Fire alarm\", etc.\n",
    "    - In Pull Requests, squash commits and write meaningful messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Apply a branch strategy.\n",
    "+ Submit clean pull requests: verify that the latest branch has been merged and review any conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commit Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Clear commit messages help document your code and allow you to trace the reasoning behind design decisions. \n",
    "+ A few guidelines for writing commit messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use markdown: GitHub interprets commit messages as markdown.\n",
    "    - First line is a subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * No period at the end.\n",
    "        * Use uppercase as appropriate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Write in imperative form in the subject line and whenever possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Do:  \"Add connection to db\", \"Connect to db\"\n",
    "        * Do not:  \"This commit adds a connection to db\", \"Connection to db added\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The body of the message should explain why the change was made and not what was changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Diff will show changes in the code, but not the reasoning behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Same rules apply for Pull Requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Many of these points are taken from [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) by Chris Beams."

    "+ A branching strategy is a way to organise the progression of code in your repo. \n",
