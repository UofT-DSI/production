So, if I set the random state to be 42, whenever I run the function with random state set as 42, the outcome will always be the same. \n",
    "It is useful since it allows reproducibility and verify the stability and reliability of the model. Also, the consistent train-test split allows comparison of model performance on eaxt same training and testing datasets, which helps in debugging and ensuring that the improvements in model performance are due to changes in model or parameters, not variations in the data split. Lastly, the random state offers consistency that allows all team memebrs to share findings and collaborate on teh same dataset "
